**Advising**
 Dr. Anthony J. Clark

This is a pretty long document that can serve as a one-stop shop for all advising related activities. You might find it useful to search the page for something in-specific. For example, if you don't know what computer scientists do, you might search the page for "jobs." One last note: **I am an important part of your Missouri State experience**, you should plan on meeting with me to discuss classes, careers, and any troubles you might be having (academic or otherwise).


Here are some quick highlights about me:
- You can call me Tony, Dr. Clark, or professor Clark.
- I am originally from the KC area.
- I have a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Engineering from Kansas State University.
- I have a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Computer Science from Michigan State University.
- I typically teach three classes per semester (CSC 325, CSC 333, and a graduate class).
- [I work with both undergraduates and graduate students on building small, robust autonomous robots](https://people.missouristate.edu/AnthonyClark/arcs-lab/).

Instructions for Advising Meetings
===============================================================================

Generally, you do not need to contact me before stopping by my office. You should feel free to stop by and chat about anything. **However**, if you'd like to get **released to enroll** for the next semester, I'd like you to do a little prep work before we meet:

- Send me an email to setup a time to meet (usual we'll need about 30 minutes).
- Come to my office prepared with questions and/or topics to discuss.
- Come to my office with a list of courses that you are considering.

You don't need to have your schedule planned out, but it will help me get an idea for what you'd like to take. Here are some other general tips:

- I prefer face-to-face meetings the first couple of times we discuss your schedules.
- If you know your schedule or have a quick question, then we can discuss via email.
- To make an appointment send me an email with a couple of days notice and with a few of your preferred meeting times.
- Let me know if you are going to be more than 10 minutes late and we can reschedule.

It might seem like a small things, but I highly recommend [**setting-up email on your phone**](https://w2.outlook.com/l/mobile?WT.mc_id=Outlook_Front_Door). Almost all communication on campus will be via email, and some of it will be very time sensitive (for example, a canceled class, meeting, or office hours).



A Typical Advising Meeting
===============================================================================

I'll usually ask you the following question:

- Why computer science?
- Why did you choose your option (Computer Science or Software Development)?
- WHy did you choose your minor?

- flowcharts
- minors
- certificates
- typical gen ed courses


Frequently Asked Questions
===============================================================================

What is the difference between [*Computer Science*](https://computerscience.missouristate.edu/), [*Management and Information Systems* (computer information systems, information technology)](https://mit.missouristate.edu/), and [*Computer Engineering*](https://www.missouristate.edu/egr/electrical/Computer-EGR-Minor.htm)?
: To put it simply: <u>computer scientists</u> study programming, theory, and methods for developing large programs, <u>management and information systems students</u> focus more on business, using software as a tool, and making decisions on computer hardware (specs, prices, etc.), and <u>computer engineers</u> work more on *low-level* software that more interacts directly with hardware (sometimes called embedded systems, like writing a driver for a new USB device so that it can talk to the operating system).


What is the difference between the [*Computer Science* (CS)](https://computerscience.missouristate.edu/undergraduate/Computer-Science-Option.htm) and [*Software Development* (SD)](https://computerscience.missouristate.edu/undergraduate/Software-Development-Option.htm) options?
: **Math**. The biggest difference between these two options is that CS students typically get a math minor, and SD students choose from any other option available on campus. The SD option is new, but so far we've seen no indication that employers treat CS and SD students differently.


What minors do Software Development students choose?
: cybersecuirty, web development, business, foreign language, graphic design, story telling, etc., math (more information in section Getting a Job) (see section A Typical Advising Meeting)


What kind of jobs do computer science students get?
: salaries, companies, success rates for department


What is the engineering program?

How do I get involved in computer science on campus?

What programming languages should I know?

How can I get help with writing/math/interviewing/finances/TODO?

Can I test-out (not have to take) the beginner CS courses?
